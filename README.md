# Time-Series-Mining-Approach-for-Agriculture-Area-Detection

This proposed soltuion finds viable solution to farmers for the benefit of the society, uses AL(Active Learning) approach for time series classification in order to monitor specific crops in different areas and consists of selecting seasonal time series information from less than 1% of each classâ€™ pixels to build the training set and evaluate this selection by an expert user supported by distance measurements, repeating this process until both distance measurement thresholds were satisfied. This framework can then help **Land Use Change** (LUC) monitoring as it produces similar results compared to other methods that demand more human and financial resources to be adopted.

Technology Used : **Python**

This was my Bachelor's Major Project.
